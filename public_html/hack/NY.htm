    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No NYS permit is required for long guns. Handguns require a permit. Permits are issued by County or State Supreme Court judges/justices outside of New York City, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, with a background check. Permits for those wanting to carry concealed are issued on a "may issue" basis, whereas permits to merely purchase and possess handguns in the home are issued on a "shall issue" basis.</td>

  <td>Firearm registration?</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No registration for long guns. All handguns must be registered under a license. There is a $3 registration fee. Handguns are registered with purchase permit. The serial number and sale is noted down. It is illegal to possess any un-registered firearm. Antique weapons are exempted from this. All handguns must travel in the manner one's license is issued. No record is needed of previously owned handguns with law enforcement.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>Owner license required?</td>
	<td>No</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No license is required for long guns; however, New York State requires a license for handgun ownership. Handgun licenses are normally restricted to three types: residence or business premises permit (must issue generally), Target & Hunting, and Unrestricted Carry. Target and hunting allows carry while engaged in those activities. Unrestricted allows carry at any time. All permits issued outside of New York City are not valid in New York City EXCEPT for retired police and federal law enforcement officers with that status marked on their permit and for armored car guards on duty.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Permit required for concealed carry?</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>New York counties, and some police departments, issue pistol licenses on a "may issue" basis. Discretionary issuance policies vary widely across the state. Generally, it is harder to obtain a license in counties closer to large New York cities. Most counties that aren't a part of downstate New York have shall/reasonable issuance policies, but may administratively restrict time or place of carry (such as only for target shooting or hunting). It is not a crime to carry a weapon under a Target or Hunting permit for other purposes, but if caught or reported the permit will likely be revoked. Concealed carry without any kind of permit must be charged as a felony unless the weapon is unloaded and no ammunition for it is in possession of the person carrying. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Permit required for open carry?</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>The law is extremely vague on open carry. Open carry in public is not legal in most instances. While no law specifically bans open carry, a license to carry is issued to carry concealed as per penal law 400. Therefore, pistol permit holders must carry concealed. Open carry permitted while hunting and possibly on one's own property. Open carry of unloaded long guns is not explicitly prohibited by any law, but is generally not practiced. It is illegal however to transport an uncased long gun in a motor vehicle, unless it is in the trunk or a compartment not accessible by anyone inside the vehicle.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>State preemption of local restrictions?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>New York preempts only handgun licensing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Assault weapon law?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Possession of assault weapons is prohibited, except for those legally possessed on January 15, 2013 and registered with the state by January 15, 2014 or classified as an antique assault weapon. New York City, Buffalo, Albany, and Rochester have enacted their own assault weapon bans. Law enforcement and retired law enforcement are exempt from the assault weapons ban. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NFA weapons restricted?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Ownership of machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles, and short-barreled shotguns are prohibited to the average citizen. Destructive devices are permitted except for rockets with greater than 3 ounces of propellant, which are prohibited. AOW's are legal to own but are still required to be on a pistol permit. AOW's disguised as non-firearms are illegal. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Background checks required for private sales?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>For firearm transfers between private parties, a licensed dealer must conduct a background check, provide documentation of the check to the New York State Police, and keep a record of the transaction.</td>
