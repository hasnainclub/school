For Linux platforms :<p>

Linux distributions come with 2 tn3270 emulators :</p><p>
</p><ul>
x3270 - an X-Windows based terminal program.<br>
c3270 - curses (text) based terminal program.<p>
</p></ul>
You may have to install them from a distribution. Additionally, you need
to work out how to map the PF keys to the keyboard you are using before
you start the program or you may find it very difficult to terminate the
program.<p>

The simpest way to access Marist with c3270 is :</p><p>
</p><ul>
c3270 zos.kctro.marist.edu:1023<p>
</p></ul>
The default keymap for c3270 that assigns the PF keys to the PC function 
keys works only if you are directly logged into your Linux system. Logins 
done via remote ssh, especially from Windows systems, use a keymap that is 
not recognized by c3270.<p>

The keymap for x3270 does work from remote login.</p><p>
