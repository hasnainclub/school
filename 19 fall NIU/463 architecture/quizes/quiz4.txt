What is a half adder?

Selected Answer:	
A half adder is a type of adder, an electronic circuit that performs the addition of numbers. The half adder is able to add two single binary digits and provide the output plus a carry value. It has two inputs, called A and B, and two outputs S (sum) and C (carry). The common representation uses a XOR logic gate and an AND logic gate.

Correct Answer:	
Correct 
A circuit that can add two one-bit binary input values and output a one-bit sum and a one-bit carry.

Correct	
How is a full adder different from a half adder?

Selected Answer:	
The difference between a half-adder and a full-adder is that the full-adder has three inputs and two outputs, whereas half adder has only two inputs and two outputs.

Correct Answer:	
Correct 
A full adder can add three input bits and a half adder can only add two.

A full adder requires more gates than a half adder.
Full adders may be combined to add multi-bit input values while half adders can not.

Correct	
What does a decoder do?

Selected Answer:	
A combinational logic circuit that converts binary information from the n coded inputs to a maximum of 2^n unique outputs. 

Correct Answer:	
Correct 
A decoder has n input bits and 2^n outputs.  The input bits represent an address that determines which one of the outputs will be set to true.

Correct	
What is a decoder useful for?

Selected Answer:	
Converts binary information from the n coded inputs to a maximum of 2^n unique outputs.  They are used in a wide variety of applications, including data demultiplexing, seven segment displays, and memory address decoding.

Correct Answer:	
Correct 
Decoders are useful for building other circuits like multiplexers and demultiplexers.  For example, a demultiplexer is a decoder with an 'enable'  input bit.

Correct	
What does a multiplexer do?

Selected Answer:	
In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux) is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards it to a single output line. A multiplexer is also called a data selector. Multiplexers can also be used to implement Boolean functions of multiple variables.

Correct Answer:	
Correct 
A multiplexer has n address inputs, 2^n data inpouts and one data input.  It will send the input bit that is selected by the address value to the output.

Correct	
What is the difference between a sequential and a combinatorial circuit?

Why does a sequential circuit need a clock line?

Selected Answer:	
Combinational circuits are defined as the time independent circuits which do not depends upon previous inputs to generate any output are termed as combinational circuits.    Sequential circuits are those which are dependent on clock cycles and depends on present as well as past inputs to generate any output.
 Sequential circuit uses clock signal and level inputs (or pulsed) . The output pulse is the same duration as the clock pulse for the clocked sequential circuits.  Level output changes state at the start of an input pulse and remains in that until the next input or clock pulse.

Correct Answer:	
Correct 
sequential circuits maintain and react to a stored state in addition to any input signals it may have while combinational circuits only react to their input signals.

Sequential circuits have at least one internal signal that feeds back into its own input.

A clock line is needed to tell a sequential circuit when to update its state.

Question 14

Correct	
What is the rising edge? falling edge? edge-triggered circuit? level-triggered circuit?

What type of circuits are used in memory and registers?

Selected Answer:	

A rising edge (or positive edge) is the low-to-high transition.

A falling edge (or negative edge) is the high-to-low transition.

An edge-triggered flip-flop changes states either at the positive edge (rising edge) or at the negative edge (falling edge) of the clock pulse on the control input.  Any edge from above

A Level-triggered circuit is a circuit which cares for the state (actual value) is rather than the change in state.

Edge triggered circuits are used in memory and registeres.  

Correct Answer:	
Correct 
rising edge = a transition from 0 to 1

falling edge = a transition from 1 to 0

edge triggered = a circuit that updates its internal state in response to an edge on a clock input signal such as a master-slave memory latch.

level triggered = a circuit that updates its internal state in response to a level on an enable input signal such as a transparent D latch.

Memory and registers use edge-triggered latches.
