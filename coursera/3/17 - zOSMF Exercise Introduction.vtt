00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.615
It's time to get
hands-on with ZOSMF.

2
00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:08.700
Now, the screens I
showed you were from

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.025
the desktop version of ZOSMF,

4
00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:14.310
and this lab uses the traditional
menu-driven approach.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.515
Under the covers,
it's all the same.

6
00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.840
But this way, you get to
see both versions because

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.780
not all mainframe shops are
going to use the same one.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.850
You'll log into ZOSMF using

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.500
the Firefox browser located

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.450
on your virtual
machine's desktop.

11
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.340
Then you'll explore
around a little bit,

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.080
see how to connect
to the console,

13
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.490
enter some commands, and

14
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.455
check out the system
configuration.

15
00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:36.195
There's a lot to do in here,

16
00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.260
so let's get started.
