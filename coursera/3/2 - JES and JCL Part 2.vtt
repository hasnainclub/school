1
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.620
JCL statements consist of
one or more 80 byte records.

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.930
However, be careful
when you get close to

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.540
the end of that line
there because columns

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.030
73 through 80 are ignored by

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.750
z/OS and are usually used
for sequence numbers.

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.000
If you've got a command
with a whole lot of

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.080
parameters that you need to

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.520
continue on to the second line,

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.395
here's what you do.

10
00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:28.785
Note, this is only how you
continue for a parameter.

11
00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.930
If you've got a comment or

12
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.465
a parameter field
enclosed in parentheses,

13
00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:35.925
those require something
slightly different.

14
00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:38.655
But if you've got
a list of parameters,

15
00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:42.330
interrupt the field after
a complete parameter entry,

16
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.280
making sure to end
it with a comma.

17
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.570
That comma needs to come
at or before columns 71.

18
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.270
In the next line which you are

19
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.190
going to be continuing into,

20
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.150
start with two forward slashes
and then a blank space.

21
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.550
If column three starts
with anything other

22
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.159
than a blank space
or an asterisk,

23
00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.710
splat, it will assume

24
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.250
it's a new line and
probably won't run right.

25
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.720
You can then pick up
your continued commands

26
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.900
starting anywhere from
columns 4 through 16.

27
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.240
You should also know that
there's different types of

28
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.435
statements: JOB, EXEC, and DD.

29
00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:20.000
You can see all
three types here and

30
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.170
they all have parameters that

31
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.820
are expected to follow them.

32
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
I also want to talk to you
about those dispositions you

33
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.880
see here because you'll
definitely be running into those.

34
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.620
But before we can get into that,

35
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.525
we have to cover cataloging.

36
00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.934
Now, cataloging a dataset

37
00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:37.505
just means that we add
the exact location

38
00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:39.590
of that dataset so we can find it

39
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.620
later referencing it
only by its name.

40
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.450
Datasets can exist without
being in a catalog,

41
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.085
you just have to know exactly
where they are to use them.

42
00:01:48.085 --> 00:01:50.405
Having a dataset in your catalog

43
00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.985
is like having a phone number
in your address book.

44
00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:54.530
So if you want to reference

45
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.840
a dataset by its name later on,

46
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.615
make sure it's in
the catalog. That's it.

47
00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:03.020
When you specify the disposition
in a DD statement,

48
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.145
you're specifying what to do
with the datasets in JCL.

49
00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:10.835
You do this across three fields
separated by a comma.

50
00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:13.535
Don't worry, there's
an example after this.

51
00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:15.810
You start with DISP equals,

52
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.220
that sets it all up.

53
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.520
In the first field,

54
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.080
we're specifying whether
it should be NEW,

55
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.660
either it doesn't exist
yet so we should make it.

56
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.960
OLD, meaning it
should already exist.

57
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.630
SHR, the data can be
used by other jobs.

58
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.510
MOD, if the dataset

59
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.480
doesn't already exist,
then create it.

60
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.930
If it already does
exist, then use that.

61
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.445
In the next statement,

62
00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:41.930
we specify what action
the system needs to

63
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.745
perform on the dataset

64
00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:46.355
when the JOB step
terminates normally.

65
00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:48.500
We can either DELETE it,

66
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.220
get rid of it. KEEP it.

67
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.010
If you're referencing a dataset,

68
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.920
you expect it to be
there when it started,

69
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.065
you probably want
to keep it around.

70
00:02:57.065 --> 00:02:59.900
PASS, meaning that if
there's a step after

71
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.245
this step that needs
the dataset, let them use it.

72
00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.820
CATLG, add it to the catalog,

73
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.320
make it permanent or UNCATLG,

74
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.025
remove it from the catalog.

75
00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:12.410
Then lastly in the third column.

76
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.240
What to do if a JOB step

77
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.170
terminates abnormally if
something bad happens.

78
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.800
Same as the previous column,

79
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.365
but there's no option
for PASS because,

80
00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:22.820
if the job is stopping,

81
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.400
there are no future steps
to pass it onto.

82
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.310
So here's an example
of a DD statement with

83
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.525
a disposition of
NEW, CATLOG, DELETE.

84
00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:33.875
We're going to
create a new dataset

85
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.870
and if the JOB runs successfully,

86
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.115
add it to the catalog.

87
00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:38.870
Otherwise, delete it.

88
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.230
I know this was a lot of
information and believe me,

89
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.930
I wish that were everything.

90
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.400
