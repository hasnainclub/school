00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.270
On the mainframe, the big
three that immediately come to

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.315
mind are CICS, IMS, and Db2.

3
00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:10.890
When I first started working on

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.810
z Systems I heard
these said together

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.280
so often but I thought it was

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.425
two things CICS, IMS, and Db2.

7
00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.260
But we're talking
about three components

8
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.945
here there's kicks, or CICS,

9
00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:24.770
spelled CICS, IMS, and Db2.

10
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.210
Three different things.

11
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.135
Let's start with CICS.

12
00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:31.310
CICS has been around for
a long time and it powers

13
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.790
many of the world's
transactions such as ATM's,

14
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.715
managing insurance
policies, utility bills,

15
00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:39.920
retail shopping, and others.

16
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.120
It does it all securely and
reliably day in and day out.

17
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.220
A CICS transaction consist of

18
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.345
many facets including
delivering the user interface,

19
00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:51.445
retrieving and
updating information,

20
00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:53.720
and communicating with
other applications

21
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.670
and network attached devices.

22
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.145
In CICS, a transaction
typically lasts

23
00:00:58.145 --> 00:00:59.930
a very short time and is

24
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.605
associated with one unit of work.

25
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:05.690
CICS takes the work to be
processed and lines it

26
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.555
up with the program or programs
required to complete it.

27
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:11.000
This was the job of the
transaction manager,

28
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.880
to ensure the work complete
successfully according to

29
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.860
the process and that
there's nothing left

30
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.910
hanging out there when we tell

31
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.530
the user that it's complete.

32
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.230
Here's what's under the hood
that lets this all happen.

33
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.870
A CICS system manages an area of

34
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.440
storage called a region which
lives in an address space.

35
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.075
You'll hear that term
a lot, a CICS region.

36
00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:33.140
A CICS region uses
domains which contain

37
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.960
management nodes for
transaction processing.

38
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.050
Now, a single region
can be defined to

39
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.520
perform all the functions

40
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.820
necessary to process
a transaction.

41
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.660
Typically, a CICS installation

42
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.490
will have several
different regions,

43
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.910
each one devoted to a
different type of transaction.

44
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.130
Think of it like an
auto repair center.

45
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.585
This area's for body work,

46
00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:55.880
over here is for
transmission issues,

47
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.485
tires and wheels over there.

48
00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:00.350
That way, all the tools
that are needed are close

49
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.640
by and the area isn't

50
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.680
crowded with stuff
that they don't need.

51
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.230
There are three types
of domains that

52
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.200
supervise and control
transaction processing.

53
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.310
Remember, these are the
domains within the region.

54
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.020
We've covered a lot there.

55
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.410
So let's make sure we've
got the basic order right.

56
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.110
A CICS system manages
an area of storage

57
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.820
called a blank and within
that it uses blanks.

58
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.325
Let's see if you remember
what those are called.

59
00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:33.860
So a CICS system manages areas
of storage called regions.

60
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.615
Then within the regions,
it manages domains.

61
00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:41.055
There's a transaction
manager, the XM,

62
00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.985
which is responsible for
receiving transaction requests

63
00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:47.180
and creating the organizing
tasks to process them.

64
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.900
Then there's the program
manager or PG which handles

65
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.880
locating and invoking
applications

66
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.445
required for processing
transactions.

67
00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:58.295
Then there's these
Storage Manager, SM.

68
00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:00.560
This domain is responsible
for allocating

69
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.815
memory resources required
for all of this to happen.

70
00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:05.660
You can see in this diagram,

71
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.310
we have three types of regions.

72
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.025
There's the TOR,
terminal owning region,

73
00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:11.330
which handles connections to

74
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.370
terminals and other
remote devices.

75
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.140
Then there's the AOR
for application owning

76
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.550
region and the DOR for
Data owning region.

77
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.700
The glue that connects
these regions is VTAM.

78
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.080
Now we haven't really spent

79
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.925
much time talking about VTAM yet,

80
00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:27.770
and we're not going
to get deep into it.

81
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.210
Just know that it has to do with

82
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.870
networking and it's
part of comm server.

83
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.160
The AORs and DORs talk

84
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.440
with other applications
like databases,

85
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.555
and user written applications.

86
00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:41.345
One of those databases
could be IMS.

87
00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:42.970
Now what's IMS?

88
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.040
IMS, Information
Management System has

89
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.110
a long and interesting
history as well

90
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.735
which includes some
development done for NASA.

91
00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:54.240
What makes IMS unique
is that it has or is,

92
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.600
depending on how you look at it,

93
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.895
a hierarchical database
management system.

94
00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:01.400
It is widely used for
manufacturing type of

95
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.020
applications but you'll see it

96
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.230
in just about any industry.

97
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.435
IMS consists of three components.

98
00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.295
One is the database manager.

99
00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:12.350
That's the IMS DB.

100
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.470
Then there's the
transaction manager.

101
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.435
That's the IMS TM.

102
00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:18.920
Then there's these system
services that provide

103
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.460
common services to both
the DB and the TM.

104
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.950
These work together
to deliver data and

105
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.715
transactional capabilities in
an extremely efficient way.

106
00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:32.955
For more complex data
handling needs, there's Db2.

107
00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:36.050
Big D little b2.

108
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.980
Db2 is a database and it offers
exceptional availability,

109
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.410
massive scalability,
flexibility, and

110
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.780
installation across
platforms and location,

111
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.345
and a low total
cost of ownership.

112
00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:50.240
Db2 is considered to be
a relational database.

113
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.385
So data exists in one or more
constructs known as tables.

114
00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:56.090
Within those tables, there are

115
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.580
columns and rows and you interact

116
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.990
with data by using the structured
query language or SQL.

117
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.925
Though you can also use Db2 for

118
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:07.325
unstructured data
and so much more.

119
00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:10.580
Remember those acid properties
we've talked about before?

120
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.000
Db2 people take each one
of those very seriously.

121
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.200
They won't chase something that

122
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.850
gives them increased availability

123
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.390
if it means giving up
consistency and vice versa.

124
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.705
When it comes to truly
enterprise applications,

125
00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:25.130
the middleware like CICS,

126
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.710
IMS, and Db2 need to step up and

127
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.830
deliver time after time
after time after time.

128
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.270
Can't stop, won't
stop. Transaction.
