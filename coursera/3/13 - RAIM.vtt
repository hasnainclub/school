00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.460
Hi everyone, my name
is Tina Tarquinio ,

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.950
and I am a director
on the IBM Z Team.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.510
Today, I want to talk
to you about one of

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.185
my favorite parts of
the IBM Z system,

5
00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:13.650
and that's it's redundancy and

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.645
availability characteristics.

7
00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:17.850
In today's world, workloads

8
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.380
are getting stronger
and stronger,

9
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.000
and we require more
and more of them,

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.925
and we're seeing bigger and
more dense memory available.

11
00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:28.680
So we introduced over

12
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.155
10 years ago something
called RAIM memory,

13
00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.810
Redundant Array of
Independent Memory.

14
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.240
This is one of the key
characteristics of what makes

15
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.225
a system so available
and so reliable.

16
00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.135
So as you know, I
talked about workloads,

17
00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:43.830
things like in transaction

18
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.000
analytics are becoming
more and more prevalent,

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.930
and we're increasing
the size of memory.

20
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.430
So when IBM z14,

21
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.025
you can have up to 32
terabytes of memory.

22
00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:53.985
So what is RAIM memory?

23
00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:57.345
As I said, we introduced
it with IBM z196,

24
00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:01.115
and it is the key characteristics
of our availability.

25
00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.455
So if you can imagine
a processor unit,

26
00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:06.200
every processor unit
has one memory unit,

27
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.545
and within the memory
unit is five DIMMs,

28
00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:12.800
and up to one DIMM is set
aside for redundant memory.

29
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.330
That means you can
lose a channel,

30
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.950
and you can lose an entire DIMM,

31
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.170
and still have
complete availability

32
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.550
of your memory subsystem.

33
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.720
Like I said, this was introduced
with IBM z196 in 2010,

34
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.325
and every server that's come out

35
00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:27.875
after will include
this RAIM memory.

36
00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.635
Now what happens if
you don't have this?

37
00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:30.750
That means in the middle of

38
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.955
a transaction if you
have a memory error,

39
00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:35.545
data is lost, that's not good.

40
00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.330
Especially when we have qualities

41
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.820
of service and service
agreements with our clients,

42
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.000
that they expect
100 percent availability.

43
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.805
In fact, that is what the Z
and IBM Z stands for,

44
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.100
zero downtime, that
includes the server,

45
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.120
and all of the
subsystems within it.

46
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.550
This is just one aspect of

47
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.170
how we've built availability and

48
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.320
reliability into every subsystem
of the IBM mainframe,

49
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.480
that includes the memory
like I talked about,

50
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.450
but also the I/O and
the processing units.

51
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.040
So when I brag about

52
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.280
the mainframe and
what a great server it is,

53
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.720
this is the main reason I like
to start with our clients.
