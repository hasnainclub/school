Hi, my name is Louisa Martinez,

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.065
I work for USS.

3
00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:09.945
So last time, Jeff
talked a little bit

4
00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:12.660
about z/OS Unix and Sysplex.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.400
So now I'm going to
be talking about

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.680
how they both work together.

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.885
So in z/OS Unix,

8
00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:23.215
you have access to the entire
file system hierarchy.

9
00:00:23.215 --> 00:00:25.380
The way this is done is that

10
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.990
once your file system is mounted,

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.020
an owning only LPAR is assigned.

12
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.670
So once this is mounted,

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.725
now all the LPARs and users
have access to this file.

14
00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:38.960
This is kind of done in two ways,

15
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.675
one way is that through COS Unix,

16
00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.750
we forward all the
transactions and

17
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.070
requests associated with
one file to the owning LPAR.

18
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.655
Another way is called
Six Flex aware.

19
00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:55.345
This is also called
as read write share.

20
00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:58.040
In this case,
the files are mounted

21
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.839
locally to your LPAR and
instead of forwarding,

22
00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.720
they're handled within that.

23
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.055
The reasons why someone might
choose one over the other,

24
00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.435
could be for performance,

25
00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.420
or convenience, or it
could be just by choice.

26
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.150
Overall, just the share
file system environment

27
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.860
has a lot of advantages,

28
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.870
such as your z/OS Unix data

29
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.140
it's always available,
regardless.

30
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.300
So even if you're owning LPAR,

31
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.970
were to come down for
one or the other reason,

32
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.550
your z/OS Unix data is still

33
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.655
available for you to
use from other systems.

34
00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:34.370
This is just a brief
explanation how this works,

35
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.050
but if you're curious
and want to find

36
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.345
out more about all the details,

37
00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:39.920
there's tons of documentations

38
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.675
online you can go and read,

39
00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:43.520
and that's all I had to share,

40
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.010
hopefully this was useful,

41
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.800
again my name is Teresa Martinez.
