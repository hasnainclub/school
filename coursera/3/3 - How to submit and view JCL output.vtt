00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.635
Once you've got your JCL written chances
are you actually want to submit it and

2
00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:09.482
make it run.

3
00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:13.595
As you've probably picked up on by now
when there's something you want to do

4
00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:15.800
there is usually eight ways to do it.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.941
So I'm going to show you two ways
of submitting your JCL to Jazz.

6
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:26.073
To begin we're going to open up
option to of ispf, for edit.

7
00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:27.661
That will bring us to this screen.

8
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:33.499
And you just specify the data set either
using the ispf library fields up there or

9
00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.723
the one below it labeled other partitions,

10
00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:40.225
sequential or VSAM Data Set or
z/OS UNIX file.

11
00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:43.541
That will bring up this
listing of data set members.

12
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:48.409
Place an s next to the one you
want to select and hit enter.

13
00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.921
TSO will come back and
pop up a little message saying, got it.

14
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:53.300
I have submitted your job.

15
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.600
Here's the job number I gave it.

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.600
Now I said,
there's more than one way to do things.

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.700
So I'm going to show you another
way of submitting JCL to Jazz.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.669
If you're at TSO prompt you can
submit a job from here too.

19
00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:11.604
Just type TSO submit followed by
the data set member spelled out as

20
00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:16.461
the data set name and
then the specified member in parentheses.

21
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:21.606
The data set and data set member
should be within single quotes.

22
00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:23.674
It sounds a lot more
complicated when I say it.

23
00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:25.946
Just look at how it's spelled out here.

24
00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:29.599
But when you put the TSO at
the beginning of a statement,

25
00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.717
you're issuing a TSO command.

26
00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.990
So if you have some JCL and
you don't even have to look at it,

27
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.145
you just know you want to run it,
that's how you do that.

28
00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:44.297
To look at the output of that job head
into SDSF from the primary ispf menu.

29
00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:48.938
Then go into option H because
we want to look at held jobs.

30
00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:51.200
As you can see there's
a lot you can do in here.

31
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.899
All in due time all in due
time when we hit enter for

32
00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.233
the held jobs we get a listing of output.

33
00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.300
And we can do a number of things with it.

34
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.400
Right now we want to display that output.

35
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.533
So we'll place an s next to it and
hit enter.

36
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.688
That will bring up all of
the output from that job.

37
00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:12.989
As I said, there's a lot you can
do in here with other commands.

38
00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.789
But the most common commands
are probably S for display,

39
00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:21.293
C for cancel, P for purge and X for print.

40
00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:25.056
When you do view the output first thing
you'll notice is that it is tremendously

41
00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:25.569
verbose.

42
00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.758
And we're not going to get into that here.

43
00:02:27.758 --> 00:02:32.421
Pretty much every piece of information
regarding the execution of that job is

44
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:33.001
in here.

45
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.597
And it would take a whole lot of
time to fully explore that output.

46
00:02:36.597 --> 00:02:38.710
So we'll just stop right here and

47
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.090
be happy that we know how to build
JCL submit it and manage the output.

48
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.059
Stay tuned though,

49
00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.200
later on I'm going to show you
another way to look at system output.
