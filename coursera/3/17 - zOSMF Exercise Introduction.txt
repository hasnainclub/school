It's time to get
hands-on with ZOSMF. Now, the screens I
showed you were from the desktop version of ZOSMF, and this lab uses the traditional
menu-driven approach. Under the covers,
it's all the same. But this way, you get to
see both versions because not all mainframe shops are
going to use the same one. You'll log into ZOSMF using the Firefox browser located on your virtual
machine's desktop. Then you'll explore
around a little bit, see how to connect
to the console, enter some commands, and check out the system
configuration. There's a lot to do in here, so let's get started.
