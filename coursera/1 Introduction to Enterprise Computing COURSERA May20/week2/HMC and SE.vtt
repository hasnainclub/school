1
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.160
So I said we'd come back to

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.140
that SE thing with the keyboard,

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.505
screen, and the servers,

4
00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:10.320
the computer within a computer.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.790
What's that there fore=?

6
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.385
That's the support
element or the SE.

7
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:15.930
In order to get the mainframe

8
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.610
all configured and
ready to boot up

9
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.750
the way we want it to and

10
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.895
connected everything
we needed to talk to,

11
00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.605
that takes a little
bit of a setup,

12
00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.740
and you do that setup
through the support element.

13
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.650
There's two SE's in there,

14
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.535
and that's just in case
one of them fails.

15
00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:31.710
No one wants to be locked
out of their system.

16
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.110
Now that's all cool,

17
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.750
but imagine if every time
we needed to do something,

18
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.710
you had to walk over to
the data center, badge in,

19
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.030
hang out on the raised floor
where it's all loud,

20
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.740
and cold, and dark, and stuff,

21
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.470
open the door, slide out the SE,

22
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.500
and all that, just to type
out a single command.

23
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.020
Luckily, in addition to the SE's,

24
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.700
mainframes have this concept of

25
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.939
the HMC or the hardware
management console,

26
00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:57.680
and these do four things.

27
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.160
One, they let you access
the SE's Functions remotely,

28
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.340
so you don't have to
walk out there anymore.

29
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.175
Two, you can add multiple
mainframes to a single HMC,

30
00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.645
a 100 of them in fact.

31
00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.150
So you can manage a whole bunch
of mainframes from

32
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.030
one HMC and that is pretty handy.

33
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.025
You can also add a single
mainframe to multiple HMC's,

34
00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:19.490
32 of them in fact.

35
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.335
So if you have one system

36
00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:23.195
that's shared by
multiple departments,

37
00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:25.670
they can all get HMC access.

38
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.655
Four, you can connect
to the HMC remotely.

39
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.650
So while the SE is attached to

40
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.430
the system and the HMC is
running somewhere else,

41
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.405
you can also connect remotely

42
00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:37.775
as long as you have
the correct network access.

43
00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:39.620
Now for the remainder
of this session,

44
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.020
I'm just going to be
saying HMC because

45
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.975
that's typically how someone
accesses those functions.

46
00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:47.990
But know that pretty much
anything I can do from the HMC,

47
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.400
I can do from the SE as well.

48
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.120
It's just a whole lot
easier just to say HMC.

49
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.945
So why would we need
that kind of access?

50
00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:56.780
Well, the most common
thing people

51
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.730
use an HMC for is to stop,

52
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.205
start, create, and
modify our pars.

53
00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:03.880
Need to add another couple
processors to an L part,

54
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.845
you do that from the HMC.

55
00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:08.180
When it changed the way
a network card is configured,

56
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.355
you do that for the HMC.

57
00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:11.780
Let's say I'm having problems

58
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.920
with the system and I want to get

59
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.090
some data that might help me

60
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.445
with troubleshooting, guess what?

61
00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:20.525
HMC. What do I see when
I login to an HMC?

62
00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:21.950
Well, I can take a look at

63
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.580
a particular physical machine

64
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.190
that's this view right here.

65
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.740
See you got the status
is operating,

66
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.945
It's going to machine
type, model number,

67
00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:31.435
It's also got a serial number,

68
00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:33.050
It's also got
this name over here,

69
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.160
so I can make sure it's

70
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.095
the system that I want
to be talking to.

71
00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:38.920
If I go deeper, I can
see all the L parts,

72
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.600
those are the partitions
right there for that system.

73
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.980
Looks like some of them are up,

74
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.945
some of them are down.
That's all right.

75
00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:47.750
In this last tab over
here that's the topology,

76
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.685
that shows me how
everything is connected.

77
00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:52.115
You can see there's lots of
stuff going on over here.

78
00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:54.320
Another good use
of the HMC is just

79
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.780
telling at a glance how
my systems are doing.

80
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.450
So I can see right here there's
a couple of exceptions.

81
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.290
An exception is an unacceptable
status and it could be

82
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.640
a problem with lpar or

83
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.640
any other objects like
a network or a crypto card.

84
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.830
These need to be
checked out right away.

85
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.990
There's also a number
of hardware messages.

86
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.150
Now, a hardware message
is just when

87
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.650
some components saw something

88
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.330
and at once you
don't know about it,

89
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.540
but it's not currently stopping
anything from working,

90
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.795
it's just letting you now.

91
00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:22.580
For example, if a fiber cable

92
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.635
got disconnected and
then reconnected,

93
00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:26.330
that would result in
a hardware message.

94
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.280
Same thing if an lpar
didn't shut down

95
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.384
correctly or HMC somewhere
lost connectivity,

96
00:03:31.384 --> 00:03:33.740
that would result in
a hardware message.

97
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.795
So what gets stored on the SC?

98
00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:37.470
Well, it's got code that's going

99
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.180
to get loaded onto the mainframe,

100
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.695
that's called Licensed
Internal Code or LIC.

101
00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:45.140
Yeah. Really. We've got

102
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.465
logging and problem
determination Functions

103
00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:49.295
which help in debugging issues,

104
00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:52.130
hardware systems definitions
which basically tell

105
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.150
the mainframe how to get

106
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.965
started up when it
first fluids up.

107
00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:57.020
Then there's the IOCDS which will

108
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.180
definitely be talking
about later on.

109
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.070
That tells the mainframe
how to configure

110
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.215
all of its IO and it's L pars.

111
00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:05.630
There's also a battery
operated clock that

112
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.850
it uses a synchronized
time across all of

113
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.265
the components and
Ethernet adapters

114
00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:11.720
because of course everything in

115
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.610
the mainframe
environment generally is

116
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.450
connected to other components,
so we need that.

117
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.340
Lastly, you might be thinking,

118
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.630
so if anyone could
log into the HMC,

119
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.860
they could probably mess up

120
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.765
a whole bunch of
stuff accidentally.

121
00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:25.820
Well, which is why there are

122
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.040
several accounts set
up by default on

123
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.830
the typical HMC and
most people set up even

124
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.100
more to partition access off
to those who really need it.

125
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.995
Just because you have
access to some features,

126
00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:39.155
doesn't mean you have
access to everything.

127
00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:42.919
There's specific roles on
the HMC, roles like operator,

128
00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.980
and Advanced operator,
Systems programmer,

129
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.740
access Administrator, and
service representative.

130
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.410
Each one of these roles
has a specific reason

131
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.980
for needing specific access
to the system,

132
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.540
so it's not an all or
nothing kind of thing.

133
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.940
That's the SE and the HMC,

134
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.340
the computers within
your computer,

135
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.410
and within those computers,

136
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.345
there's actually no there's not.

137
00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:08.790
That's it. It's
just the SE and the HMC.
