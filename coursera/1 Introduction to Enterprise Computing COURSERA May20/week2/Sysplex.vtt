1
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.615
Ask a bunch of Mainframers what
makes their platform so powerful and

2
00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:11.487
there's a good chance a good number
of them will tell you it's sysplex.

3
00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:16.675
Simply put, sysplex is a way of making
multiple systems work together as a team

4
00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:22.600
and this can be LPARs on one physical box,
or it can be spread out across many.

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.679
Before we get into
exactly how it does this.

6
00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.300
We first have to define
a couple of basic concepts.

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.800
First, there's STP,
the Server Time Protocol.

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.700
Systems need to be in exact agreement
about time, like exact agreement and

9
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.423
that kind of makes sense.

10
00:00:38.423 --> 00:00:42.339
If you've got multiple systems writing
to the same file milliseconds apart and

11
00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.200
you're trying to figure out which
one got to that piece of data first.

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.000
Having your watches synchronized
is kind of important.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.600
Then there's GRS,
the Global Resource Serialization.

14
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.035
This allows for multiple systems to
access the same resources concurrently,

15
00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:01.409
serializing where necessary
to ensure exclusive access.

16
00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.000
Without GRS, you have quite a mess.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That's a handy rhyme.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.308
You should remember that in
case you're tested on it later.

19
00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:12.041
XCF, the Cross Coupling Facility,

20
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:17.300
this manages communication between
applications in a sysplex.

21
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.800
This also lets you be
logged into one system and

22
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.700
issue commands on behalf of
another system in that sysplex.

23
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.908
This right here is what let's
the sysplex communicate as a whole.

24
00:01:27.908 --> 00:01:30.500
Next up, the Coupling Links.

25
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.800
These connect LPARs to processors.

26
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.300
Without these, accessing memory
on different physical systems

27
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.300
would have to run through one of those
LPARs and these allow direct memory access

28
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.100
communications between sysplex memory and
the memory of an attached system.

29
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.353
Finally, there's the CDS,
the Coupled Data Set.

30
00:01:49.353 --> 00:01:52.552
So imagine you've got a bunch of
people working on the same job and

31
00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:55.986
let's just say they're tallying up
the numbers of different colored

32
00:01:55.986 --> 00:01:58.800
candies they're getting from
various bags of candies.

33
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.800
Bags of candies.

34
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.300
Anyway, they're all working
together to get one final result,

35
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.300
which means they're all working
on the same set of data.

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.000
Now, in order to coordinate
this operation so

37
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.900
someone doesn't accidentally overwrite
someone else's work, there needs to be

38
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.900
an additional file that keeps track of
who is currently working on a resource.

39
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.008
So everyone knows how to wait their turn.

40
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.100
That's the CDS.

41
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.380
These parts are super important
when you're talking about sysplex,

42
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.896
because without them you've just got
another distributed environment.

43
00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:33.908
Those memory links, the tightly
coupled resources, and of course,

44
00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:37.861
being an absolute lockstep on time
is the only way this will all work.

45
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:42.300
We talked a little bit earlier about WLM,
the Workload Manager.

46
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.534
It's the component that makes sure that
high priority work gets run quickly and

47
00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:48.248
that all of our targets are met.

48
00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:53.500
WLM makes quite a bit of use of
sysplex to help balance things out.

49
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.000
So if that discussion earlier about
performance tuning on the Mainframe was

50
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.800
interesting to you, sysplex is something
you want to pay close attention to.

51
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.800
Sysplex is at its core, a bunch of z/OS
operating systems working together.

52
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.425
They're able to cooperatively
use hardware, software and

53
00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:14.800
components to achieve a high availability
workload processing environment.

54
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.500
This gets us back to the whole
physical logical discussion.

55
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.625
And when you have systems in a sysplex,
when you're talking about how they're

56
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:25.900
going to handle the work, you essentially
have one entity that is running the work.

57
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.400
It's the sysplex.

58
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.900
Even though you know that you've got
multiple physical mainframes and

59
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.500
within those multiple logical LPARs,
you'll often hear people just refer

60
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.500
to it all collectively as the sysplex or
just the plex.

61
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.806
Let's talk about those
sysplex configurations.

62
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.046
There are three main ways
you can configure a sysplex.

63
00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:50.647
Now, bit of a riddle, if you've got
a sysplex with only one LPAR in it,

64
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.200
is it really a sysplex?

65
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.935
The answer is yes, and
it's called a monoplex.

66
00:03:55.935 --> 00:04:00.200
Now, you'll often see a monoplex
in testing and staging situations.

67
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.000
But beyond that, it doesn't really
buy you any additional performance or

68
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.600
functionality.

69
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.300
Then there's this concept
of a base sysplex.

70
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.830
In this configuration, every system has
a connection to every other system, and

71
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.851
they all know about each other, and
they all agreed to do work together.

72
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:19.147
It's almost like they
started a little band.

73
00:04:19.147 --> 00:04:23.200
The most common form of the sysplex
though is the parallel sysplex.

74
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.572
In this configuration,

75
00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:28.242
instead of needing every system
connected to every other system.

76
00:04:28.242 --> 00:04:30.639
We have this concept of
a Coupling Facility.

77
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.658
This is a special type of
LPAR that you bring up, and

78
00:04:33.658 --> 00:04:37.110
typically you have backups of
it on other Mainframes too.

79
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.757
In a parallel sysplex, the Coupling
Facility handles all the complexities and

80
00:04:41.757 --> 00:04:44.476
overhead of those systems
working together.

81
00:04:44.476 --> 00:04:50.543
So you can have up to 32 z/OS images and
up to 32 physical Mainframes.

82
00:04:50.543 --> 00:04:56.800
That would mean one LPAR on each
Mainframe hooked into a 32 way sysplex.

83
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.000
Now, most systems aren't
scaled out that way.

84
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
But if you need to, you could do it.

85
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.898
Now, a word about availability.

86
00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:08.600
You might hear people say that a Mainframe
environment hasn't gone down in decades.

87
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.716
But how is that possible unless they're
running on 20 year old hardware and

88
00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:13.360
software.

89
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.409
Well, one of the neat things about being
in a sysplex is you can do what's called

90
00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:18.600
a rolling IPL.

91
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.200
An IPL is just booting up
an operating system, and

92
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.800
a parallel sysplex doesn't require all
the systems in it to be up in order

93
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.600
to function,
just enough to keep it running.

94
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.525
So if I've got 16 LPARS in my sysplex,
we're just saying,

95
00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:37.129
I can bring down four of them,
update the operating systems on them, and

96
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.315
then bring them back up and
put them into the plex.

97
00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:43.611
LPAR has got upgraded and
the Plex stayed up.

98
00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:46.245
I can even do this with physical
systems as long as the,

99
00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:49.400
some of the members are running
elsewhere in other Mainframe.

100
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.377
So let's go back to those 16 LPARs,
say, they're spread out across for

101
00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:56.679
Mainframes, just as an example.

102
00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:00.000
And we want to upgrade one of those
mainframes to a shiny brand new one.

103
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.400
We bring down the four LPARs on that
system that we want to replace,

104
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.100
physically swap it out with a new one.

105
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.101
Cable it up, configure it the way
we want to, power it back on.

106
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:13.368
IPL will boot up those four
systems on the new hardware,

107
00:06:13.368 --> 00:06:16.700
vary them back into the plex and
we're good to go.

108
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.300
The plex never went down.

109
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.300
That is some pretty amazing stuff and
you can see why so

110
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.100
many people would tell you
it's their favorite feature.

111
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.976
Although it's hard to pick just one,
isn't it?
