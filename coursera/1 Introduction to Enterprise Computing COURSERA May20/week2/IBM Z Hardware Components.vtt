00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.340
One of the systems
you're likely to run

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.650
into is the IBM z14.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.365
Now, you may not be
working on a z14,

4
00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:12.015
you may have something older,

5
00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.120
you may have something newer.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.240
But chances are, it will
look something like this.

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.995
The parts might look
a little different,

8
00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:21.405
they might be rotated,

9
00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.580
they might be in
a slightly different place,

10
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.800
but for as long as
I can remember,

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.705
the core components
of the mainframe have

12
00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:30.180
always looked more
or less like this.

13
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.650
Starting from the right,

14
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.170
and I'll explain why in a minute,

15
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.175
you've got the CPC drawers.

16
00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:36.840
They call them
drawers because they

17
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.970
pull open like a drawer
in a nightstand.

18
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.170
In here, you've got all the

19
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.180
processors and all the memory.

20
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.009
They've also got
the PCIe fanouts,

21
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.600
which is a fancy way of
saying all the cables that

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.750
hook up to all the
PCIe I/O cards.

23
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.050
It's also got the flexible
support processor which gives

24
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.520
you redundant interfaces to

25
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.260
all the internal
management network,

26
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.550
so you're never locked out,

27
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.560
you can always log into
one of these things.

28
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.395
There's also two DCA invertors.

29
00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:05.300
These provide the specific power

30
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.850
that everything in here needs,

31
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.410
and there's two of them,
just in case one goes down.

32
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.610
Down here we've got
the radiator pumps.

33
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.760
These circulate
refrigerant throughout

34
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.220
the system keeping it down.

35
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.230
It takes the cold air being
blown up from the floor,

36
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.165
and blows the hot air
out the back.

37
00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:22.130
So cold air in the bottom,

38
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.330
hot air on the back,

39
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.715
chilled refrigerant all
throughout the system.

40
00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:28.070
There are also
water-cooled systems which

41
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.330
tap into a site's
chilled water lines.

42
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.790
Looks slightly different but

43
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.770
everything else is
pretty much the same.

44
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.430
This right here is
the PCIe I/O drawer.

45
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.175
This is where all the
input-output devices live.

46
00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:41.660
That's your crypto cards,

47
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.780
network cards, compression
cards, and Phi card.

48
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.160
Up top over here,
there's batteries,

49
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.500
there's two of them, and they're

50
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.330
bigger than any batteries I own.

51
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.640
They're there to provide
a safe shutdown.

52
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.590
So if the power does go out,

53
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.565
none of the transactions
in flight get lost.

54
00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:59.600
You've got four power supplies.

55
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.940
Now, depending on how
your mainframe is configured,

56
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.440
you may have less than four,

57
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.750
but part of the reason
for so many is,

58
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.535
you guessed it, redundancy.

59
00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:10.400
So ideally, if you've
got four power supplies,

60
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.600
you've got two of
them hooked up to

61
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.130
a power panel over here,

62
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.080
and two others hooked
up to a power panel

63
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.550
over there for redundancy sake.

64
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.509
Lastly, there's
this display keyboard

65
00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.375
and these two servers up here.

66
00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.260
Those are called the
support elements.

67
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.340
We're going to come back to that

68
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.110
so much more on that in a minute.

69
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.340
I do want to mention that

70
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.200
your mainframe might
look like this.

71
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.510
It might also be
a single frame design.

72
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.310
Now, a single frame design,

73
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.590
usually called a
business-class machine,

74
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.105
is still a mainframe.

75
00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:39.950
It's for environments
that don't require

76
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.420
quite as much hardware so

77
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.220
they can fit it all
into a single frame.

78
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.830
You might also find
your mainframe the newer ones

79
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.295
especially in an industry
standard 19 interact.

80
00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:52.280
That's the size cabinet that
most IT equipment lives in,

81
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.480
stuff like servers,

82
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.940
storage devices, and
networking equipment.

83
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.740
That means the mainframe
doesn't have to

84
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.390
live off in its own special area,

85
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.100
it can be right in
the middle of it all.

86
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.520
So while the older mainframes
get their own unique area,

87
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.230
the rough metal ones
get to hang out with

88
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.210
all their other IT
equipment buddies.
