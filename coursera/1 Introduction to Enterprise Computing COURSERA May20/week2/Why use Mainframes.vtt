00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.300
So why use mainframes?

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.690
Because no two businesses are alike,
even competitors in the same field.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.277
Mainframes need to be open,
adaptable and ever-evolving.

4
00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:17.283
And that's before we even talk about the
processing power, or the system capacity.

5
00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:21.628
Because mainframes the built for business,
they need to support anything a business

6
00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:24.354
could possibly want as part
of their business model.

7
00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:26.840
When the first companies
started using Linux,

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.209
Linux became a supported operating system.

9
00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:30.622
When open source software and

10
00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:33.909
hybrid cloud models started becoming
part of the way work gets done.

11
00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:38.092
You started seeing APIs and cloud-ready
solutions appear on the Mainframe.

12
00:00:38.092 --> 00:00:41.042
What I'm getting at here is,
is that if it's important,

13
00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.042
you'll find it here on the mainframe.

14
00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:46.042
So for example,
let's talk about Linux for a minute.

15
00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:51.000
Because this is a great example of
something that runs really well on Z.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.760
Linux runs great on my
rented Cloud instance,

17
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.165
it runs great on the server under my desk,
it even runs on my Raspberry Pi.

18
00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:01.944
So why do I want to run Linux on the
mainframe, is it going to run any better?

19
00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:06.704
Well, what if I could make a Linux
instance with 15 processors and

20
00:01:06.704 --> 00:01:08.466
a couple gigs of memory?

21
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:13.029
And I also wanted to access 32
different storage area networks and

22
00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:16.300
a couple of different network VLANs.

23
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.200
Well, I can get that big
powerful Linux system.

24
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.535
But I can also run that Linux with all of
its data being encrypted, at all times,

25
00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.364
through pervasive encryption.

26
00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:27.683
So that's possible and that's pretty cool.

27
00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:30.444
I could build five more of
those same exact servers,

28
00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:34.732
without needing five times the physical
resources because of virtualization.

29
00:01:34.732 --> 00:01:36.147
That's a huge bonus.

30
00:01:36.147 --> 00:01:40.965
I can even bring up Linux Docker instances
within the z/OS operating system,

31
00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:44.256
where they can run right
next to z/OS applications.

32
00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:46.012
So I don't need a full system image,

33
00:01:46.012 --> 00:01:48.517
if there's just one specific
application in need.

34
00:01:48.517 --> 00:01:52.158
Part of the big reason for running things
on the mainframe is consolidation.

35
00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:56.100
Now companies are always looking for
ways to save money on operations.

36
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.900
So in addition to being able to bring
all of those compute resources,

37
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.100
like the CPU and memory into one big box.

38
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.799
Companies are also able to consolidate
things like power supplies,

39
00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.722
networking adaptors and cooling.

40
00:02:08.722 --> 00:02:12.630
Having one larger efficient
cooling unit in a mainframe,

41
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.028
is much better than having 300
individual CPU fans out there.

42
00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:21.553
In business, you'll often find two
major types of transactions happening.

43
00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:25.085
There's real time transactions,
that's like stuff that is reactionary,

44
00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:27.327
event-based, needs-to-happen right now.

45
00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:30.537
That's stuff like swiping a credit card,
making a purchase,

46
00:02:30.537 --> 00:02:32.303
changing your insurance policy.

47
00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:34.416
That stuff needs to happen instantly.

48
00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:38.048
And then there's batch processes, which
we've talked about a little bit before.

49
00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:41.236
But that kind of summarizes changes
in actions that have happened during

50
00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:42.026
a period of time.

51
00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:46.170
Like figuring out paychecks, or figuring
out your phone bill for the month,

52
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.711
those are batch processes.

53
00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:52.192
The mainframe excels in doing both,
from a performance security and

54
00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:54.286
a data integrity point of view.

55
00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:58.088
Just to give an idea about how
prevalent the mainframe is and

56
00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:00.458
what a powerhouse it is in business.

57
00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:06.030
They power 68% of the world's
production workloads, 68%.

58
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.800
That's that's more than half,
its quite a bit more than half, yeah,

59
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.474
it's two-thirds,
that's more than two-thirds.

60
00:03:14.474 --> 00:03:19.328
So despite running two-thirds of
the world's production workloads,

61
00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:22.800
they take up only 6% of the total IT cost.

62
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.656
Think about that, 6%, to run 68%,
okay, I'm a little bit biased.

63
00:03:29.656 --> 00:03:33.822
But I happen to think that even if I
wasn't sitting in an IBM studio right now,

64
00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:35.437
that would still impress me.

65
00:03:35.437 --> 00:03:38.900
And that's why I'm so excited you're
here to learn all about the IBM Z.

66
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.482
You'll walk into a job interview and
tell them, you know Parallel Sysplex,

67
00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:44.408
IODF configs.

68
00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:47.520
You put down on a résumé that you
know about z/OS components and

69
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.291
how to manage mainframe security.

70
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:51.789
You're putting yourself in a great place.

71
00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:53.183
I hope you're having fun,

72
00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:56.100
I know I am, because these
skills are great ones to have.
